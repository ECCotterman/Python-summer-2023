## Objectives
You are an analyst for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Your task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Key Questions (Examples)
##### ● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
##### ● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts. 
##### ● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
##### ○ What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
##### ○ Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
##### ○ Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering
habits?

## Project Tasks & Deliverables
Throughout this Achievement, you’ll work on your project from one Exercise to the next, completing tasks as you go. For each task, you’ll submit a deliverable that makes up a piece of your project.
